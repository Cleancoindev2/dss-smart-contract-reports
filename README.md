# DSS Smart Contract Reports

A collection of reports about the [dss](https://github.com/makerdao/dss) smart contracts.  These are largely generated using [Surya](https://github.com/ConsenSys/surya).

## Instructions
1. Install surya
2. Clone dss relative to the reports directory (`../dss` is default and can be overwritten with `$DSS_DIR`)
2. `chmod a+x reports.sh`
3. ./reports.sh

This will replace the contents of the `./reports` directory with new reports.
